pensieve-glass
================

Glass application using a derivative of Arpan/Sina's pensieve server, which we have adapted for speech-to-text applications.

Note: The server address is defined in res/values/strings.xml. You will need to change the IP address to the address of the machine which is running pensieve-speech when the application is started.

Second note: This project is currently an early work in progress and is not guaranteed to function correctly. Or at all, really.
